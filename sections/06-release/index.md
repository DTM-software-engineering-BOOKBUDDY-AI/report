# Release

This document outlines the components, target environments, deployment steps, licensing, and versioning strategy for the BookBuddy application.

## What to Release

A release of BookBuddy typically involves packaging the following components:

* **Backend Application:** Python Flask code, including routes, models, forms, and service logic.
* **Frontend Assets:** HTML templates (located in `Bookbuddy_app/Templates/`), CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files (located in `Bookbuddy_app/static/`).
* **Dependencies:** The list of required Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`.
* **Database Migrations:** Scripts needed to update the database schema, if applicable for the release.
* **Configuration:** Secure management of sensitive details like `SECRET_KEY` and `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` is critical. This is often handled through environment variables (potentially loaded via `python-dotenv` during development) and by ensuring configuration files containing secrets are listed in `.gitignore`.

## Deployment Target (Where)

The application is designed to be deployed to a web server or a cloud platform capable of hosting a Python Flask application. Examples include:

* Heroku
* AWS (Amazon Web Services)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure
* Other Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers or self-hosted servers.

The deployment environment must be configured to serve the application via HTTP/HTTPS. While the included SQLite database (`instance/bookbuddy.db`) might be suitable for development or very small-scale deployments, a more robust database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is generally recommended for production environments to ensure scalability and reliability.

## How to Deploy

A typical deployment process involves the following steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required Python packages are installed on the target server:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Set Up Production Environment:** Configure the server environment, which usually includes:
    * A production-grade WSGI server (like Gunicorn or uWSGI) to run the Flask application efficiently and securely.
    * Setting up and configuring the chosen database system (if different from development).
    * Defining necessary environment variables (API keys, secret key, database connection strings, `FLASK_ENV=production`, etc.).
3.  **Database Setup/Migration:** Run any necessary database initialization or migration scripts to prepare the database schema.
4.  **Start Application:** Launch the Flask application using the configured WSGI server.
5.  **(Optional) Containerization:** Consider using containerization technologies like Docker to package the application, its dependencies, and its runtime environment. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments (development, staging, production).

## Licensing

### Current Status
 **Choice of the License:**
*   **Which one and why:** The project uses the **Apache License 2.0**, as specified in the `LICENSE` file and `README.md`. This is a permissive license that allows for broad use, modification, and distribution, while also providing patent protection and defining contribution terms. It's a common and well-regarded choice for open-source projects.

## Versioning Schema

### Current Status

Unfortionatly we did not opt for versioning during the development process.
