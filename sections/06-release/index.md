# Release

This document outlines the components, target environments, deployment steps, licensing, and versioning strategy for the BookBuddy application.

## What to Release

A release of BookBuddy typically involves packaging the following components:

* **Backend Application:** Python Flask code, including routes, models, forms, and service logic.
* **Frontend Assets:** HTML templates (located in `Bookbuddy_app/Templates/`), CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files (located in `Bookbuddy_app/static/`).
* **Dependencies:** The list of required Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`.
* **Database Migrations:** Scripts needed to update the database schema, if applicable for the release.
* **Configuration:** Secure management of sensitive details like `SECRET_KEY` and `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` is critical. This is often handled through environment variables (potentially loaded via `python-dotenv` during development) and by ensuring configuration files containing secrets are listed in `.gitignore`.

## Deployment Target (Where)

The application is designed to be deployed to a web server or a cloud platform capable of hosting a Python Flask application. Examples include:

* Heroku
* AWS (Amazon Web Services)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure
* Other Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers or self-hosted servers.

The deployment environment must be configured to serve the application via HTTP/HTTPS. While the included SQLite database (`instance/bookbuddy.db`) might be suitable for development or very small-scale deployments, a more robust database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is generally recommended for production environments to ensure scalability and reliability.

## How to Deploy

A typical deployment process involves the following steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required Python packages are installed on the target server:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Set Up Production Environment:** Configure the server environment, which usually includes:
    * A production-grade WSGI server (like Gunicorn or uWSGI) to run the Flask application efficiently and securely.
    * Setting up and configuring the chosen database system (if different from development).
    * Defining necessary environment variables (API keys, secret key, database connection strings, `FLASK_ENV=production`, etc.).
3.  **Database Setup/Migration:** Run any necessary database initialization or migration scripts to prepare the database schema.
4.  **Start Application:** Launch the Flask application using the configured WSGI server.
5.  **(Optional) Containerization:** Consider using containerization technologies like Docker to package the application, its dependencies, and its runtime environment. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments (development, staging, production).

## Licensing

### Current Status

No explicit license file (e.g., `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`) was found in the root directory of the `code-rep-for-bookbuddy` repository. **In the absence of an explicit license, standard copyright laws apply by default. This means the code is proprietary and others do not have permission to use, modify, or distribute it without explicit permission from the copyright holder.**

### Recommendation

If the project is intended to be shared or allow contributions, choosing an open-source license is crucial. Common choices include:

* **MIT License:** A very permissive license that allows broad reuse with minimal restrictions (requires only attribution and inclusion of the license text). It's excellent for encouraging adoption and modification.
* **Apache License 2.0:** Similar to MIT in permissiveness but also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.
* **GNU GPLv3 (General Public License):** A "copyleft" license. It requires that derivative works or distributions incorporating the code must also be licensed under the GPLv3, ensuring that modifications remain open source.

The appropriate license depends on the project's goals. For many web application projects intended for general use and community contribution, the **MIT License** offers a simple and popular balance. It is highly recommended to add a `LICENSE` file to the repository's root directory clearly stating the chosen license terms.

## Versioning Schema

### Current Status

No specific version number (e.g., `1.0.0`) or defined versioning schema was identified within the project files reviewed (like `config.py` or a dedicated version file) or through Git tags.

### Recommendation

Adopting a standard versioning schema is highly recommended for tracking releases, managing dependencies effectively, and clearly communicating the nature of changes between versions. **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** is the most widely adopted and understood standard.

* **Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)
    * Increment `MAJOR` version for incompatible API changes.
    * Increment `MINOR` version for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
    * Increment `PATCH` version for backward-compatible bug fixes.
* **Benefits:** SemVer provides clear expectations for users and developers about the impact of updating the software.
* **Implementation:**
    * It's common practice to start initial development releases at `0.1.0`.
    * The first stable, public release should typically be `1.0.0`.
    * Use Git tags (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0`) to mark specific release points in the version history.
    * Optionally, store the canonical version number within the project code itself (e.g., defining a `__version__` variable in the main package's `__init__.py`, like `Bookbuddy_app/__init__.py`).
