User Guide
----------

This section outlines the user experience when navigating and utilizing the features of this software, assuming it has been correctly deployed.

### 1\. Initial Interaction: The Landing Page

Upon visiting the website, the user is first presented with the **Landing Page**. From here, they have two primary initial actions they can take:

-   **Search for Books:** A search bar is readily available, allowing users to directly look for specific books.
-   **Book Discovery:** Users can click on a "Book Discovery" option.

### 2\. Account Creation (Sign Up)

If a user clicks on "Book Discovery" for the first time, or if they attempt to access features requiring an account, they will be redirected to the **Sign-Up Page**. Here, they will need to create an account to proceed.

### 3\. User Profile Management (Dashboard)

Once signed up and logged in, the user gains access to their personal **Dashboard**. Within the dashboard, they can manage their profile information, including:

-   Adding or editing a personal biography (bio).
-   Changing their avatar (profile picture).
-   (Potentially other profile settings can be listed here if applicable).

### 4\. Discovering Books via Questionnaire

To find new books tailored to their preferences, the user can navigate to the **Book Discovery** section. Here, they will be prompted to:

-   **Fill out a Form/Questionnaire:** This form will gather information about their reading preferences, genres of interest, or other relevant criteria.

Based on the answers provided in the questionnaire, the system will generate personalized book recommendations.

### 5\. Receiving and Interacting with Recommendations

After submitting the questionnaire, the user will be presented with a list of recommended books. For instance, they might receive 5 recommended books that match their responses.

From this list of recommendations, the user can:

-   **Select Books:** Choose one or more of the recommended books.
-   **Add to Virtual Library:** Add the selected books to their personal virtual library.

### 6\. Managing the Virtual Library

The user's **Virtual Library** allows them to organize the books they are interested in or have interacted with. They can assign different statuses to these books, such as:

-   **Wants to Read:** Books the user plans to read in the future.
-   **Has Read:** Books the user has completed.
-   **Is Reading:** Books the user is currently reading.

Users can view and manage all books within their library, categorized by these statuses.

### 7\. Direct Book Search

At any point while navigating the website, the **Search Bar** remains accessible. This allows users to bypass the recommendation system and search directly for books by title, author, or other keywords, regardless of whether they are new to the site or have an established profile.
