As a student with management background , this was my first experience building a website. One of my biggest challenges was dealing with my limited technical knowledge, especially at the start. Although I wasn’t very active during the summer break, I made up for it in the final stages by putting in extra time and effort. This project taught me the value of responsibility, teamwork, and being open to feedback.

Ali played a key role in shaping both the technical structure and the report. With his support, I was able to better understand the technical side and contribute more effectively. Together, we finalized key parts of the report, focusing on continuous integration and future improvements, and used AI tools to enhance our work.

In the end, we built a simple but effective website that meets its goals, and I’m grateful for the great collaboration within our team.
