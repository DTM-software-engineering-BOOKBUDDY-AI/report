# Self-Evaluation

This section provides a critical self-evaluation of the Bookbuddy project, assessing strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned throughout the development process.

## Xiuyue's Section 
For our BookBuddy project, I was responsible for the testing phase. I reviewed the lessons and adhered to a clear, well-organized testing structure, separating folders for different components-such as modules, routes, forms, etc. I also performed test-coverage and configuration checks to ensure the application’s reliability and compatibility. However, there are still some untested or overlooked directories that we can address in the near future.

In addition to testing, I served as the team’s timekeeper: tracking our progress, scheduling and organizing meetings, and making sure we stayed on track. This project was both fun and challenging-especially for those of us from non-technical backgrounds. To prepare, I studied online resources and open courses, and, with the support of my groupmates, we ultimately delivered a fully functioning and engaging book-recommendation application.

This experience was invaluable, giving me a practical, end-to-end view of software development. I’d like to thank all my group members for their outstanding collaboration-and our professors for expanding our knowledge of software engineering.

## Shahab's Section 
As a student with management background , this was my first experience building a website. One of my biggest challenges was dealing with my limited technical knowledge, especially at the start.
Ali played a key role in shaping both the technical structure and the report. With his support, I was able to better understand the technical side and contribute more effectively.  

I was responsible for structuring and styling the website by organizing JavaScript and CSS structure, creating key components like search, homepage, and profile pages. My focus was on ensuring design consistency and responsiveness across the site. 
This project taught me the value of responsibility, teamwork, and being open to feedback.In the end, we built a simple but effective website that meets its goals, and I’m grateful for the great collaboration within our team.


## Mohammad's Section

In the BookBuddy project, I worked on several important parts of the application, mainly focusing on the backend but also contributing to the frontend. One of my main responsibilities was setting up the Flask application. I configured the app so that it runs smoothly from the beginning, including setting up the necessary environment, initializing the database, and organizing the structure of the backend code.

I also connected the Google Books API to our app. I wrote the function that sends requests to the API and fetches book data based on user input. This feature was a key part of our app’s functionality, allowing users to search for and discover new books. I added API routes to make this interaction possible and helped make sure the data could flow properly between the frontend and backend.

Besides backend tasks, I helped with several HTML pages to improve the look and usability of the app. I made sure that the layout was clean and that users could easily interact with the search and recommendation features.

Working on this project taught me a lot about building a web application from scratch — not just the technical parts like Flask, APIs, and HTML, but also how to collaborate with a team, share code effectively, and manage tasks together. It was a great learning experience, and I’m proud of how much we achieved as a group.
