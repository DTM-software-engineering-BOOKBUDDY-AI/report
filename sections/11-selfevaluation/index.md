# Self-Evaluation

This section provides a critical self-evaluation of the Bookbuddy project, assessing strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned throughout the development process.

## Xiuyue's Section 
For our BookBuddy project, I was responsible for the testing phase. I reviewed the lessons and adhered to a clear, well-organized testing structure, separating folders for different components-such as modules, routes, forms, etc. I also performed test-coverage and configuration checks to ensure the application’s reliability and compatibility. However, there are still some untested or overlooked directories that we can address in the near future.

In addition to testing, I served as the team’s timekeeper: tracking our progress, scheduling and organizing meetings, and making sure we stayed on track. This project was both fun and challenging-especially for those of us from non-technical backgrounds. To prepare, I studied online resources and open courses, and, with the support of my groupmates, we ultimately delivered a fully functioning and engaging book-recommendation application.

This experience was invaluable, giving me a practical, end-to-end view of software development. I’d like to thank all my group members for their outstanding collaboration-and our professors for expanding our knowledge of software engineering.

As a student with management background , this was my first experience building a website. One of my biggest challenges was dealing with my limited technical knowledge, especially at the start. Although I wasn’t very active during the summer break, I made up for it in the final stages by putting in extra time and effort. This project taught me the value of responsibility, teamwork, and being open to feedback.

Ali played a key role in shaping both the technical structure and the report. With his support, I was able to better understand the technical side and contribute more effectively. Together, we finalized key parts of the report, focusing on continuous integration and future improvements, and used AI tools to enhance our work.

In the end, we built a simple but effective website that meets its goals, and I’m grateful for the great collaboration within our team.
