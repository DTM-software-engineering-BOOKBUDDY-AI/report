# Self-Evaluation

This section provides a critical self-evaluation of the Bookbuddy project, assessing strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned throughout the development process.

## Xiuyue's Section 
For our BookBuddy project, I was responsible for the testing phase. I reviewed the lessons and adhered to a clear, well-organized testing structure, separating folders for different components-such as modules, routes, forms, etc. I also performed test-coverage and configuration checks to ensure the application’s reliability and compatibility. However, there are still some untested or overlooked directories that we can address in the near future.

In addition to testing, I served as the team’s timekeeper: tracking our progress, scheduling and organizing meetings, and making sure we stayed on track. This project was both fun and challenging-especially for those of us from non-technical backgrounds. To prepare, I studied online resources and open courses, and, with the support of my groupmates, we ultimately delivered a fully functioning and engaging book-recommendation application.

This experience was invaluable, giving me a practical, end-to-end view of software development. I’d like to thank all my group members for their outstanding collaboration-and our professors for expanding our knowledge of software engineering.

## Shahab's Section 
As a student with management background , this was my first experience building a website. One of my biggest challenges was dealing with my limited technical knowledge, especially at the start.
Ali played a key role in shaping both the technical structure and the report. With his support, I was able to better understand the technical side and contribute more effectively.  

I was responsible for structuring and styling the website by organizing JavaScript and CSS structure, creating key components like search, homepage, and profile pages. My focus was on ensuring design consistency and responsiveness across the site. 
This project taught me the value of responsibility, teamwork, and being open to feedback.In the end, we built a simple but effective website that meets its goals, and I’m grateful for the great collaboration within our team.


## Mohammad's Section

For the BookBuddy project, I worked mostly on the backend and some parts of the frontend. I set up the Flask app, created the initial configuration, and made sure the database was set up properly when the app runs for the first time. I also connected the Google Books API, wrote the function to fetch book data, and added related API routes.

On the frontend side, I helped with some of the HTML pages to improve how the app looks and works for users. Overall, I learned a lot about building a full-stack app and really enjoyed working with my teammates to make something that actually works.
