# Self-Evaluation

This section provides a critical self-evaluation of the Bookbuddy project, assessing strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned throughout the development process.

## Alireza's Section
This project was a significant learning journey, encompassing both the acquisition of a new technology stack---Flask and its related libraries like WTForms for forms and SQLAlchemy for database management---and the development of crucial teamwork skills. I embraced a project management role, which involved writing the product backlog on our Trello board and delegating tasks. My contributions also included creating the initial website design in Figma and collaborating with the team to define the project's pages and the overall user journey through the website.

Following the initial planning and design phases, where we also distributed the front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tasks, my focus shifted to the backend. I dedicated myself to understanding the Flask framework, its file structure, and how to configure routes in the main `app.py` file. Subsequently, I built key technical components such as the database, and configured the user login and sign-up functionalities, linking them to the database. Although these technical aspects were entirely new to me, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of learning and implementing them.

## Xiuyue's Section 
For our BookBuddy project, I was responsible for the testing phase. I reviewed the lessons and adhered to a clear, well-organized testing structure, separating folders for different components-such as modules, routes, forms, etc. I also performed test-coverage and configuration checks to ensure the application’s reliability and compatibility. However, there are still some untested or overlooked directories that we can address in the near future.

In addition to testing, I served as the team’s timekeeper: tracking our progress, scheduling and organizing meetings, and making sure we stayed on track. This project was both fun and challenging-especially for those of us from non-technical backgrounds. To prepare, I studied online resources and open courses, and, with the support of my groupmates, we ultimately delivered a fully functioning and engaging book-recommendation application.

This experience was invaluable, giving me a practical, end-to-end view of software development. I’d like to thank all my group members for their outstanding collaboration-and our professors for expanding our knowledge of software engineering.

## Enes' Section

This was my first end to end software project, and I learned a lot throughout the entire process both technically and in terms of teamwork. I was responsible for writing the functions related to parsing information from the API for the search bar and the book details. I also created the HTML structure for the book details, book review, and My Library pages. Shahab helped us finalize the CSS for these pages, ensuring pages looked clean and consistent.  
In addition, I assisted Ali with finalizing the HTML for the login and sign-up pages. I learned a great deal about backend development from working closely with Mohammad and Ali. Luna kept our team on track and regularly providing feedback, which was really helpful.

We used Figma to design the pages, and everyone actively participated in the design process. We made several brainstorming meetings and translated our Figma designs into working code.

For project management, we used Trello to divide tasks and track who was working on what—this made our teamwork feel very organized and professional.  

We also did a lot of research on Flask and learned how to integrate APIs into our code. I constantly reviewed the slides and watched lecture recordings, which helped me apply what we learned in class directly to our project. Working on this project has been incredibly informative and valuable for my personal development. 
We always supported each other as a team, and I'm very happy to have worked on this project with such great teammates.


## Shahab's Section 
As a student with management background , this was my first experience building a website. One of my biggest challenges was dealing with my limited technical knowledge, especially at the start. Ali played a key role in shaping both the technical structure and the report. With his support, I was able to better understand the technical side and contribute more effectively.

I was responsible for the frontend development. I collaborated with the team to structure and style the website, organizing the JavaScript and CSS components, and developing key features such as the search function, homepage, and profile pages. My focus was on maintaining design consistency and ensuring the website was fully responsive across different devices.


This project taught me the value of responsibility, teamwork, and being open to feedback.In the end, we built a simple but effective website that meets its goals, and I’m grateful for the great collaboration within our team.


## Mohammad's Section

In the BookBuddy project, I worked on several important parts of the application, mainly focusing on the backend but also contributing to the frontend. One of my main responsibilities was setting up the Flask application. I configured the app so that it runs smoothly from the beginning, including setting up the necessary environment, initializing the database, and organizing the structure of the backend code.

I also connected the Google Books API to our app. I wrote the function that sends requests to the API and fetches book data based on user input. This feature was a key part of our app’s functionality, allowing users to search for and discover new books. I added API routes to make this interaction possible and helped make sure the data could flow properly between the frontend and backend.

Besides backend tasks, I helped with several HTML pages to improve the look and usability of the app. I made sure that the layout was clean and that users could easily interact with the search and recommendation features.

Working on this project taught me a lot about building a web application from scratch — not just the technical parts like Flask, APIs, and HTML, but also how to collaborate with a team, share code effectively, and manage tasks together. It was a great learning experience, and I’m proud of how much we achieved as a group.
